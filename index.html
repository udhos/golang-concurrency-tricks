<ul>
  <li>
1. Do not close a channel from a receiver goroutine. Closing the channel from a receiver could make future sender goroutines to panic.
  </li>
  <li>
2. If a channel has multiple senders, do not close the channel from a sender goroutine. Closing the channel from a sender could make future sender goroutine to panic.
  </li>
  <li>
3. It is not required to close an unused channel. If no goroutine is left referencing the channel, it will be gargabe collected.
<br>
<q>Note that it is only necessary to close a channel if the receiver is looking for a close.  Closing the channel is a control signal on the channel indicating that no more data follows.</q>

  </li>
  <li>
4. Do not close a channel more than once because it would panic.
  </li>
  <li>
5. Channels work better enclosed in a select.
<br>
<q>If you are ever using a channel outside of a select in production code, you are probably doing it wrong.</q>

  </li>
  <li>
6. If you need bidirectional communication between two goroutines, consider using two unidirectional channels. Then any side will be able to use the close idiom to signal termination.
  </li>
  <li>
7. Beware: one sender goroutine risks blocking indefinitely when writing on a channel if there is no goroutine left receiving from it.
</li>
